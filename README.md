# Training an AI to play snake game
Created normal snake game using Pygame in Python. Created an AI by applying Reinforcement Learning and implemented it on the game. Plotted the results on graph using MatPlotlib. During first 50 games AI scores poorly (learning phase) and after 150 games, the AI scores 40 points on average amd does not take any random actions. From the graph plotted using helper.py, we can see that the score is increasing with number of games played. Till the 20 games, the scores was 2, and from 40 to 75 games the was between 5 and 20. From 80th games onwards, the score improved drastically because model started to learn about the new conditions in the environment. So it took the steps from the experience it gained.
