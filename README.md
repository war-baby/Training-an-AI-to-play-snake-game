# Training an AI to play snake game
Created normal snake game using Pygame in Python. Created an AI by applying Reinforcement Learning and implemented it on the game. Plotted the results on graph using MatPlotlib. During first 50 games AI scores poorly (learning phase) and after 150 games, the AI scores 40 points on average amd does not take any random actions.
